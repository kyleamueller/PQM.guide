## Remarks

`Record.FromList` constructs a record by pairing a list of values with a corresponding list of field names. The values list and the field names list must have the same number of items. The `fields` parameter can be either a simple list of text names or a record type that also specifies the data type for each field. This function is useful for dynamically building records from column names and values extracted at runtime.

## Examples

### Example 1: Create a record from column names and values

Build a record using Sales column names and the values from the first Sales row.

Input: `Sales`

```powerquery
let
    Names = Table.ColumnNames(Sales),
    Values = Record.FieldValues(Sales{0}),
    NewRecord = Record.FromList(Values, Names)
in
    Record.ToTable(NewRecord)
```

<!--output
{"columns":[{"name":"Name","type":"text"},{"name":"Value","type":"any"}],"rows":[{"Name":"OrderID","Value":1},{"Name":"CustomerName","Value":"Alice"},{"Name":"Product","Value":"Widget A"},{"Name":"Category","Value":"Widgets"},{"Name":"UnitPrice","Value":25},{"Name":"Quantity","Value":4},{"Name":"OrderDate","Value":"2024-01-15"},{"Name":"Region","Value":"East"}]}
