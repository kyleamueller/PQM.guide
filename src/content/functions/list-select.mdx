## Remarks

`List.Select` filters a list by applying a condition function to each item, returning only items where the function returns `true`. This is the list equivalent of `Table.SelectRows`.

## Examples

### Example 1: Select high prices

Filter the product prices to only include values above 30.

Input: `Products`

```powerquery
let
    Prices = Table.Column(Products, "Price"),
    HighPrices = List.Select(Prices, each _ > 30)
in
    #table({"Price"}, List.Transform(HighPrices, each {_}))
```

<!--output
{"columns":[{"name":"Price","type":"number"}],"rows":[{"Price":50},{"Price":75},{"Price":120}]}
-->
