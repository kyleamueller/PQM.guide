## Remarks

`Date.DayOfWeek` returns a number from 0 to 6 indicating the day of the week for the given date. By default, 0 represents Sunday and 6 represents Saturday. You can change which day is considered the first day of the week by passing a `Day.Type` value (e.g., `Day.Monday`) as the second argument, which shifts the numbering so that the specified day becomes 0. If the input is `null`, the function returns `null`.

## Examples

### Example 1: Find the day of week for each OrderDate

Show the day-of-week number (Sunday = 0) for each OrderDate in the Sales table.

Input: `Sales`

```powerquery
Table.AddColumn(
    Table.SelectColumns(
        Table.FirstN(Sales, 5),
        {"OrderID", "OrderDate"}
    ),
    "DayOfWeek", each Date.DayOfWeek([OrderDate], Day.Sunday), Int64.Type
)
```

<!--output
{"columns":[{"name":"OrderID","type":"number"},{"name":"OrderDate","type":"date"},{"name":"DayOfWeek","type":"number"}],"rows":[{"OrderID":1,"OrderDate":"2024-01-15","DayOfWeek":1},{"OrderID":2,"OrderDate":"2024-01-18","DayOfWeek":4},{"OrderID":3,"OrderDate":"2024-02-01","DayOfWeek":4},{"OrderID":4,"OrderDate":"2024-02-10","DayOfWeek":6},{"OrderID":5,"OrderDate":"2024-03-05","DayOfWeek":2}]}
-->

### Example 2: Use Monday as the first day of the week

Return day-of-week numbers with Monday as 0 (ISO standard).

Input: `Sales`

```powerquery
Table.AddColumn(
    Table.SelectColumns(
        Table.FirstN(Sales, 4),
        {"OrderID", "OrderDate"}
    ),
    "DayOfWeekMon", each Date.DayOfWeek([OrderDate], Day.Monday), Int64.Type
)
```

<!--output
{"columns":[{"name":"OrderID","type":"number"},{"name":"OrderDate","type":"date"},{"name":"DayOfWeekMon","type":"number"}],"rows":[{"OrderID":1,"OrderDate":"2024-01-15","DayOfWeekMon":0},{"OrderID":2,"OrderDate":"2024-01-18","DayOfWeekMon":3},{"OrderID":3,"OrderDate":"2024-02-01","DayOfWeekMon":3},{"OrderID":4,"OrderDate":"2024-02-10","DayOfWeekMon":5}]}
