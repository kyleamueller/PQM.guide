## Remarks

`Number.Sqrt` returns the square root of a non-negative number. If the input is negative, an error is raised. This function is often combined with `Number.Round` to produce cleaner results.

Common use cases include distance calculations, standard deviation formulas, and normalising values by their magnitude.

## Examples

### Example 1: Square root of product prices

Calculate the square root of each product price, rounded to two decimal places.

Input: `Products`

```powerquery
Table.AddColumn(
    Table.SelectColumns(Products, {"ProductName", "Price"}),
    "SqrtPrice", each Number.Round(Number.Sqrt([Price]), 2), type number
)
```

<!--output
{"columns":[{"name":"ProductName","type":"text"},{"name":"Price","type":"number"},{"name":"SqrtPrice","type":"number"}],"rows":[{"ProductName":"Widget A","Price":25,"SqrtPrice":5},{"ProductName":"Gadget B","Price":50,"SqrtPrice":7.07},{"ProductName":"Widget C","Price":15,"SqrtPrice":3.87},{"ProductName":"Gadget D","Price":75,"SqrtPrice":8.66},{"ProductName":"Thingamajig E","Price":120,"SqrtPrice":10.95}]}
