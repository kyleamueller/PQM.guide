## Remarks

`Record.Field` retrieves the value of a single field by name from a record. This is the functional equivalent of bracket-access notation (`record[FieldName]`), but allows the field name to be supplied dynamically as a text value — which is useful when field names are computed at runtime or stored in a variable.

## Examples

### Example 1: Get the Product from the first Sales row

Return the Product field value from the first row of the Sales table.

Input: `Sales`

```powerquery
let
    ProductValue = Record.Field(Sales{0}, "Product")
in
    #table({"Product"}, {{ProductValue}})
```

<!--output
{"columns":[{"name":"Product","type":"text"}],"rows":[{"Product":"Widget A"}]}
-->
