## Remarks

`Number.Abs` returns the non-negative magnitude of a number. If the input is positive or zero it is returned unchanged; if negative, the sign is removed. This is useful when computing differences where direction does not matter — for example, finding how far each value deviates from an average.

## Examples

### Example 1: Absolute difference from a target salary

Calculate how far each employee's salary is from a target of 70000, ignoring whether it is above or below.

Input: `Employees`

```powerquery
Table.AddColumn(
    Table.SelectColumns(Table.FirstN(Employees, 4), {"FullName", "Salary"}),
    "GapFrom70K", each Number.Abs([Salary] - 70000), type number
)
```

<!--output
{"columns":[{"name":"FullName","type":"text"},{"name":"Salary","type":"number"},{"name":"GapFrom70K","type":"number"}],"rows":[{"FullName":"alice smith","Salary":55000,"GapFrom70K":15000},{"FullName":"BOB JONES","Salary":95000,"GapFrom70K":25000},{"FullName":"Charlie Brown","Salary":72000,"GapFrom70K":2000},{"FullName":"diana PRINCE","Salary":68000,"GapFrom70K":2000}]}
