## Remarks

`Number.Mod` returns the remainder of the division of `number` by `divisor`. This is equivalent to the mathematical modulo operation. A common use is classifying rows as odd or even based on an ID column, or cycling through groups for round-robin assignment.

If `divisor` is zero, an error is raised.

## Examples

### Example 1: Flag odd and even OrderIDs

Use mod 2 to determine whether each OrderID is odd or even.

Input: `Sales`

```powerquery
Table.AddColumn(
    Table.SelectColumns(Table.FirstN(Sales, 6), {"OrderID", "Product"}),
    "OddEven", each if Number.Mod([OrderID], 2) = 0 then "Even" else "Odd", type text
)
```

<!--output
{"columns":[{"name":"OrderID","type":"number"},{"name":"Product","type":"text"},{"name":"OddEven","type":"text"}],"rows":[{"OrderID":1,"Product":"Widget A","OddEven":"Odd"},{"OrderID":2,"Product":"Gadget B","OddEven":"Even"},{"OrderID":3,"Product":"Widget C","OddEven":"Odd"},{"OrderID":4,"Product":"Gadget D","OddEven":"Even"},{"OrderID":5,"Product":"Widget A","OddEven":"Odd"},{"OrderID":6,"Product":"Thingamajig E","OddEven":"Even"}]}
