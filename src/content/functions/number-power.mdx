## Remarks

`Number.Power` raises the first argument to the power of the second. For example, `Number.Power(2, 3)` returns 8. Fractional exponents are supported — `Number.Power(x, 0.5)` is equivalent to `Number.Sqrt(x)`. Negative exponents return reciprocals.

This is useful for mathematical transformations such as squaring values for variance calculations or applying exponential scaling.

## Examples

### Example 1: Square each product price

Calculate the square of each product's price.

Input: `Products`

```powerquery
Table.AddColumn(
    Table.SelectColumns(Products, {"ProductName", "Price"}),
    "PriceSquared", each Number.Power([Price], 2), type number
)
```

<!--output
{"columns":[{"name":"ProductName","type":"text"},{"name":"Price","type":"number"},{"name":"PriceSquared","type":"number"}],"rows":[{"ProductName":"Widget A","Price":25,"PriceSquared":625},{"ProductName":"Gadget B","Price":50,"PriceSquared":2500},{"ProductName":"Widget C","Price":15,"PriceSquared":225},{"ProductName":"Gadget D","Price":75,"PriceSquared":5625},{"ProductName":"Thingamajig E","Price":120,"PriceSquared":14400}]}
