## Remarks

`Table.Profile` generates summary statistics for each column in a table. The output includes columns like `Column`, `Min`, `Max`, `Average`, `StandardDeviation`, `Count`, `NullCount`, and `DistinctCount`. The statistics computed depend on the column's data type — for example, `Average` and `StandardDeviation` are only meaningful for numeric columns.

This function is useful for data exploration and quality checks — quickly identifying columns with nulls, unexpected ranges, or low cardinality.

## Examples

### Example 1: Profile the Sales table

Get the profile statistics for selected columns.

Input: `Sales`

```powerquery
let
    Source = Table.SelectColumns(Sales, {"UnitPrice", "Quantity", "Region"}),
    Profiled = Table.Profile(Source)
in
    Table.SelectColumns(Profiled, {"Column", "Min", "Max", "Average", "Count", "DistinctCount"})
```

<!--output
{"columns":[{"name":"Column","type":"text"},{"name":"Min","type":"any"},{"name":"Max","type":"any"},{"name":"Average","type":"number"},{"name":"Count","type":"number"},{"name":"DistinctCount","type":"number"}],"rows":[{"Column":"UnitPrice","Min":15,"Max":120,"Average":46.875,"Count":8,"DistinctCount":5},{"Column":"Quantity","Min":1,"Max":10,"Average":4.875,"Count":8,"DistinctCount":7},{"Column":"Region","Min":"East","Max":"West","Average":null,"Count":8,"DistinctCount":3}]}
