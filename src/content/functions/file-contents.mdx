## Remarks

`File.Contents` reads a file from the local file system (or a network share) and returns its contents as a binary value. On its own, binary is not useful — you pipe it into a parser function to interpret the data:

| File type | Parser function |
|---|---|
| CSV / TSV | `Csv.Document(File.Contents("..."), [Delimiter = ","])` |
| Excel | `Excel.Workbook(File.Contents("..."), true)` |
| JSON | `Json.Document(File.Contents("..."))` |
| XML | `Xml.Document(File.Contents("..."))` |
| Plain text | `Lines.FromBinary(File.Contents("..."))` |

### Important notes

- `File.Contents` is available in **Power BI Desktop** and **Excel Desktop** only. It is **not supported** in the Power BI Service, Excel Online, or Dataflows because these cloud environments do not have access to local file paths.
- For cloud-based scenarios, use a gateway or switch to `Web.Contents`, `SharePoint.Contents`, or another cloud-compatible data source.
- The path must be a fully qualified path (e.g., `"C:\Data\sales.csv"` or `"\\server\share\file.xlsx"`).

### Typical pattern

```powerquery
let
    Source = File.Contents("C:\Reports\quarterly.csv"),
    Parsed = Csv.Document(Source, [Delimiter = ",", Encoding = TextEncoding.Utf8]),
    Promoted = Table.PromoteHeaders(Parsed, [PromoteAllScalars = true])
in
    Promoted
```

## Examples

Since `File.Contents` requires access to a local file, live output examples are not shown. See the Remarks section above for typical usage patterns.
