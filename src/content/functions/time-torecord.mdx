## Remarks

`Time.ToRecord` converts a `time` value into a record with the fields `Hour`, `Minute`, and `Second`. Each field contains the corresponding numeric component from the time value.

## Examples

### Example 1: Convert an OrderLog time to a record

Extract the time from the first OrderLog Timestamp and convert it to a record.

Input: `OrderLog`

```powerquery
let
    FirstRow = Table.First(OrderLog),
    TimeValue = DateTime.Time(FirstRow[Timestamp]),
    Rec = Time.ToRecord(TimeValue)
in
    #table(
        type table [Hour = number, Minute = number, Second = number],
        {{Rec[Hour], Rec[Minute], Rec[Second]}}
    )
```

<!--output
{"columns":[{"name":"Hour","type":"number"},{"name":"Minute","type":"number"},{"name":"Second","type":"number"}],"rows":[{"Hour":9,"Minute":30,"Second":0}]}
-->

### Example 2: Convert a scalar time to a record

Convert a literal time value into its component parts.

```powerquery
let
    Rec = Time.ToRecord(#time(14, 30, 45))
in
    #table(
        type table [Hour = number, Minute = number, Second = number],
        {{Rec[Hour], Rec[Minute], Rec[Second]}}
    )
```

<!--output
{"columns":[{"name":"Hour","type":"number"},{"name":"Minute","type":"number"},{"name":"Second","type":"number"}],"rows":[{"Hour":14,"Minute":30,"Second":45}]}
-->
