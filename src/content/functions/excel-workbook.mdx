## Remarks

`Excel.Workbook` reads the binary content of an Excel file and returns a **navigation table** with the following columns:

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `Name` | text | The name of the sheet, table, or named range. |
| `Data` | table | The data contained within that item. |
| `Item` | text | The type of item: `"Sheet"`, `"Table"`, or `"DefinedName"`. |
| `Kind` | text | Same as Item (included for compatibility). |
| `Hidden` | logical | Whether the sheet or item is hidden. |

### Common patterns

**Load a specific sheet by name:**

```powerquery
let
    Source = Excel.Workbook(File.Contents("C:\Data\report.xlsx"), true),
    SalesSheet = Source{[Item = "Sheet", Name = "Sales"]}[Data]
in
    SalesSheet
```

**Load a named table:**

```powerquery
let
    Source = Excel.Workbook(File.Contents("C:\Data\report.xlsx"), true),
    OrdersTable = Source{[Item = "Table", Name = "tblOrders"]}[Data]
in
    OrdersTable
```

### Notes

- Pass `true` for `useHeaders` to promote the first row of each sheet to column headers automatically.
- Setting `delayTypes` to `true` can improve performance for large workbooks by deferring type inference.
- The navigation table includes all sheets, named tables, and defined names. Use row filtering (`{[Item = "Sheet", Name = "..."]}`) to drill into a specific item.
- Hidden sheets appear in the result with `Hidden = true`. Filter them out if needed.

## Examples

Since `Excel.Workbook` requires a file on disk, live output examples are not shown. See the Remarks section above for typical usage patterns.
