## Remarks

`Splitter.SplitTextByCharacterTransition` returns a **function** that splits text at the boundary where one character type transitions to another. You specify the `before` and `after` character classifications using functions like `Character.IsLetter` and `Character.IsNumber`, or by providing lists of characters.

This is especially useful for splitting strings that combine letters and digits without a delimiter — for example, splitting "ABC123" into "ABC" and "123".

## Examples

### Example 1: Split where letters transition to digits

Split product codes that combine text and numbers, such as splitting "Widget123" at the letter-to-digit boundary.

Input: `Sales`

```powerquery
let
    SplitFn = Splitter.SplitTextByCharacterTransition(Character.IsLetter, Character.IsNumber),
    Parts = SplitFn("WidgetA100")
in
    #table({"TextPart", "NumberPart"}, {{Parts{0}, Parts{1}}})
```

<!--output
{"columns":[{"name":"TextPart","type":"text"},{"name":"NumberPart","type":"text"}],"rows":[{"TextPart":"WidgetA","NumberPart":"100"}]}
-->
