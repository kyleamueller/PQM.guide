## Remarks

`Table.Skip` removes rows from the beginning of a table. When passed a number, it skips exactly that many rows. When passed a condition function, it skips consecutive rows from the top while the condition is true — it stops skipping at the first row that fails the condition.

This is the complement of `Table.FirstN`: where `Table.FirstN` keeps the first N rows, `Table.Skip` removes them. A common use case is skipping header or metadata rows in files that have non-tabular content at the top.

## Examples

### Example 1: Skip the first 5 rows

Return everything after the first 5 rows.

Input: `Sales`

```powerquery
Table.SelectColumns(Table.Skip(Sales, 5), {"OrderID", "CustomerName", "Product"})
```

<!--output
{"columns":[{"name":"OrderID","type":"number"},{"name":"CustomerName","type":"text"},{"name":"Product","type":"text"}],"rows":[{"OrderID":6,"CustomerName":"Bob","Product":"Thingamajig E"},{"OrderID":7,"CustomerName":"Charlie","Product":"Widget C"},{"OrderID":8,"CustomerName":"Diana","Product":"Gadget B"}]}
-->
