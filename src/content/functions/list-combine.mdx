## Remarks

`List.Combine` concatenates multiple lists into a single flat list. This is useful when you need to merge column values from different tables, or when building a combined list from multiple sources.

## Examples

### Example 1: Combine customer names from two tables

Merge customer names from Sales and Customers tables into one list.

Input: `Sales`, `Customers`

```powerquery
let
    SalesNames = List.Distinct(Table.Column(Sales, "CustomerName")),
    CustomerNames = Table.Column(Customers, "Name"),
    Combined = List.Distinct(List.Combine({SalesNames, CustomerNames}))
in
    #table({"Name"}, List.Transform(Combined, each {_}))
```

<!--output
{"columns":[{"name":"Name","type":"text"}],"rows":[{"Name":"Alice"},{"Name":"Bob"},{"Name":"Charlie"},{"Name":"Diana"}]}
-->
