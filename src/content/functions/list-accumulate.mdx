## Remarks

`List.Accumulate` is M's "reduce" or "fold" function. It processes each item in a list sequentially, carrying forward a state value that gets updated by the accumulator function. The final state is returned.

This is one of the most powerful list functions — it can implement running totals, string building, multi-step replacements, and any logic that requires carrying state across items.

## Examples

### Example 1: Sum quantities manually

Calculate the total quantity across all sales using List.Accumulate.

Input: `Sales`

```powerquery
let
    Quantities = Table.Column(Sales, "Quantity"),
    Total = List.Accumulate(Quantities, 0, (state, current) => state + current)
in
    #table({"TotalQuantity"}, {{Total}})
```

<!--output
{"columns":[{"name":"TotalQuantity","type":"number"}],"rows":[{"TotalQuantity":35}]}
-->
