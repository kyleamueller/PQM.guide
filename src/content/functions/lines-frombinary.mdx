## Remarks

`Lines.FromBinary` converts binary content into a list of text lines by splitting on line-break characters (CR, LF, or CRLF). This is useful for reading text files line-by-line without using `Csv.Document`.

When `quoteStyle` is set to `QuoteStyle.Csv`, line breaks inside quoted fields are not treated as line separators — this is important when processing CSV files that contain multi-line cell values.

A common pattern is to combine this with `File.Contents` to read a plain text or log file:

```powerquery
Lines.FromBinary(File.Contents("C:\Logs\app.log"))
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Split binary text into lines

Convert text to binary, then split into lines.

```powerquery
let
    Source = Binary.From("Line 1#(lf)Line 2#(lf)Line 3"),
    Lines = Lines.FromBinary(Source),
    AsTable = #table({"LineNumber", "Text"}, List.Transform({0..List.Count(Lines)-1}, each {_ + 1, Lines{_}}))
in
    AsTable
```

<!--output
{"columns":[{"name":"LineNumber","type":"number"},{"name":"Text","type":"text"}],"rows":[{"LineNumber":1,"Text":"Line 1"},{"LineNumber":2,"Text":"Line 2"},{"LineNumber":3,"Text":"Line 3"}]}
-->
