## Remarks

`List.Generate` creates a list by repeatedly applying a "next" function to a state value, continuing while a condition is true. It is M's equivalent of a `while` loop.

Common use cases include generating date sequences, paginating API calls, and building custom number ranges.

## Examples

### Example 1: Generate a date range

Generate a list of the first 5 dates starting from the earliest order date.

Input: `Sales`

```powerquery
let
    StartDate = List.Min(Table.Column(Sales, "OrderDate")),
    Dates = List.Generate(
        () => StartDate,
        each _ <= Date.AddDays(StartDate, 4),
        each Date.AddDays(_, 1)
    )
in
    #table({"Date"}, List.Transform(Dates, each {_}))
```

<!--output
{"columns":[{"name":"Date","type":"date"}],"rows":[{"Date":"2024-01-15"},{"Date":"2024-01-16"},{"Date":"2024-01-17"},{"Date":"2024-01-18"},{"Date":"2024-01-19"}]}
