## Remarks

`List.Count` returns the total number of items in a list, including nulls. This is the list equivalent of `Table.RowCount`.

## Examples

### Example 1: Count distinct regions

Count how many unique regions exist in the Sales table.

Input: `Sales`

```powerquery
let
    Regions = List.Distinct(Table.Column(Sales, "Region")),
    Count = List.Count(Regions)
in
    #table({"DistinctRegions"}, {{Count}})
```

<!--output
{"columns":[{"name":"DistinctRegions","type":"number"}],"rows":[{"DistinctRegions":3}]}
-->
