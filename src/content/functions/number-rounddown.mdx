## Remarks

`Number.RoundDown` always rounds toward zero, truncating any fractional part beyond the specified number of digits. When `digits` is omitted it defaults to 0, producing an integer. This behaves like a floor function for positive numbers.

Use this when you need to assign items to discrete buckets — for example, grouping prices into $10 bands by rounding down to the nearest ten.

## Examples

### Example 1: Floor product prices to nearest ten

Round each product price down to the nearest ten to create a price tier.

Input: `Products`

```powerquery
Table.AddColumn(
    Table.SelectColumns(Products, {"ProductName", "Price"}),
    "PriceTier", each Number.RoundDown([Price], -1), type number
)
```

<!--output
{"columns":[{"name":"ProductName","type":"text"},{"name":"Price","type":"number"},{"name":"PriceTier","type":"number"}],"rows":[{"ProductName":"Widget A","Price":25,"PriceTier":20},{"ProductName":"Gadget B","Price":50,"PriceTier":50},{"ProductName":"Widget C","Price":15,"PriceTier":10},{"ProductName":"Gadget D","Price":75,"PriceTier":70},{"ProductName":"Thingamajig E","Price":120,"PriceTier":120}]}
