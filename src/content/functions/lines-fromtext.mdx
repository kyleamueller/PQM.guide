## Remarks

`Lines.FromText` splits a text value into a list of lines by breaking on line-feed characters (CR, LF, or CRLF). It is the text-input counterpart to `Lines.FromBinary`.

This is simpler than `Text.Split(text, "#(lf)")` because it handles all common line-ending styles automatically (Windows CRLF, Unix LF, and legacy Mac CR).

## Examples

### Example 1: Split multi-line text

Split a text value containing line breaks into individual lines.

```powerquery
let
    Source = "Alice#(lf)Bob#(lf)Charlie#(lf)Diana",
    Lines = Lines.FromText(Source),
    AsTable = #table({"Index", "Line"}, List.Transform({0..List.Count(Lines)-1}, each {_ + 1, Lines{_}}))
in
    AsTable
```

<!--output
{"columns":[{"name":"Index","type":"number"},{"name":"Line","type":"text"}],"rows":[{"Index":1,"Line":"Alice"},{"Index":2,"Line":"Bob"},{"Index":3,"Line":"Charlie"},{"Index":4,"Line":"Diana"}]}
-->
