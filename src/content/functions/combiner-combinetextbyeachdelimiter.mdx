## Remarks

`Combiner.CombineTextByEachDelimiter` returns a **function** that uses a different delimiter at each join position. For example, given delimiters `{" - ", ": "}`, the first and second values are joined with `" - "` and the second and third with `": "`. This is useful when building structured strings where different separators are needed between fields.

## Examples

### Example 1: Combine with positional delimiters

Build a formatted string from Product, Category, and Region using different delimiters at each position.

Input: `Sales`

```powerquery
let
    Subset = Table.SelectColumns(Table.FirstN(Sales, 3), {"Product", "Category", "Region"}),
    CombinerFn = Combiner.CombineTextByEachDelimiter({" | ", " -> "}),
    Combined = Table.ToList(Subset, CombinerFn)
in
    #table({"Formatted"}, List.Transform(Combined, each {_}))
```

<!--output
{"columns":[{"name":"Formatted","type":"text"}],"rows":[{"Formatted":"Widget A | Widgets -> East"},{"Formatted":"Gadget B | Gadgets -> West"},{"Formatted":"Widget C | Widgets -> East"}]}
-->
