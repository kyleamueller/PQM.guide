## Remarks

`Duration.Hours` returns the hours component (0 through 23) from a `duration` value. This is the hour portion after removing whole days, not the total hours. If the input is `null`, the function returns `null`.

## Examples

### Example 1: Extract hours from OrderLog durations

Convert DurationMinutes to a duration and extract the hours component.

Input: `OrderLog`

```powerquery
Table.AddColumn(
    Table.SelectColumns(
        Table.SelectRows(
            OrderLog,
            each [DurationMinutes] <> null
        ),
        {"LogID", "DurationMinutes"}
    ),
    "Hours",
    each Duration.Hours(#duration(0, 0, [DurationMinutes], 0)),
    Int64.Type
)
```

<!--output
{"columns":[{"name":"LogID","type":"text"},{"name":"DurationMinutes","type":"number"},{"name":"Hours","type":"number"}],"rows":[{"LogID":"L002","DurationMinutes":1725,"Hours":4},{"LogID":"L004","DurationMinutes":2745,"Hours":21},{"LogID":"L006","DurationMinutes":1065,"Hours":17},{"LogID":"L008","DurationMinutes":2670,"Hours":20}]}
-->

### Example 2: Extract hours from a scalar duration

Return the hours component of a literal duration.

```powerquery
#table(
    type table [Duration = duration, Hours = number],
    {{#duration(2, 14, 30, 0), Duration.Hours(#duration(2, 14, 30, 0))}}
)
```

<!--output
{"columns":[{"name":"Duration","type":"duration"},{"name":"Hours","type":"number"}],"rows":[{"Duration":"2.14:30:00","Hours":14}]}
-->
