## Remarks

`Record.SelectFields` returns a new record containing only the fields you specify. This is the record-level equivalent of `Table.SelectColumns`. The optional `missingField` parameter controls what happens when a requested field does not exist in the record: raise an error (default), silently ignore it, or include it with a `null` value.

## Examples

### Example 1: Select a few fields from a Sales row

Keep only the OrderID, Product, and UnitPrice fields from the first Sales row.

Input: `Sales`

```powerquery
let
    Selected = Record.SelectFields(Sales{0}, {"OrderID", "Product", "UnitPrice"})
in
    Record.ToTable(Selected)
```

<!--output
{"columns":[{"name":"Name","type":"text"},{"name":"Value","type":"any"}],"rows":[{"Name":"OrderID","Value":1},{"Name":"Product","Value":"Widget A"},{"Name":"UnitPrice","Value":25}]}
-->
