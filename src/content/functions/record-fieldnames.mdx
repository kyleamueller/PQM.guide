## Remarks

`Record.FieldNames` returns the field names of a record as a list of text values. The names are returned in the same order they appear in the record. This is useful for inspecting the structure of a record or dynamically iterating over its fields. To access a single row as a record from a table, use the `table{index}` syntax — for example, `Sales{0}` returns the first row as a record.

## Examples

### Example 1: Get field names from the first Sales row

Return all field names from the first row of the Sales table.

Input: `Sales`

```powerquery
let
    FirstRow = Sales{0},
    Names = Record.FieldNames(FirstRow)
in
    #table({"FieldName"}, List.Transform(Names, each {_}))
```

<!--output
{"columns":[{"name":"FieldName","type":"text"}],"rows":[{"FieldName":"OrderID"},{"FieldName":"CustomerName"},{"FieldName":"Product"},{"FieldName":"Category"},{"FieldName":"UnitPrice"},{"FieldName":"Quantity"},{"FieldName":"OrderDate"},{"FieldName":"Region"}]}
-->
