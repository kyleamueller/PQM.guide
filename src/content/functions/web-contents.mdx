## Remarks

`Web.Contents` fetches content from a URL and returns it as a binary value. You then pipe the result to a parser such as `Json.Document`, `Csv.Document`, or `Xml.Document` to convert it into a usable M value.

### Options record fields

The optional `options` record supports the following fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `Query` | record | Append query-string parameters to the URL. e.g., `[Query = [page = "1", size = "50"]]` |
| `Headers` | record | HTTP headers to include. e.g., `[Headers = [Authorization = "Bearer token123"]]` |
| `Content` | binary | Supplying this field changes the request from GET to POST. The value becomes the POST body. |
| `RelativePath` | text | A path segment appended to the base URL. Useful for dynamic endpoint construction. |
| `Timeout` | duration | Override the default request timeout. e.g., `#duration(0, 0, 30, 0)` for 30 seconds. |
| `ManualStatusHandling` | list | A list of HTTP status codes (e.g., `{404, 500}`) that should not raise an error, allowing you to handle them in M code. |
| `IsRetry` | logical | Set to `true` to ignore any cached response and re-fetch from the server. |

### Important notes

- `Web.Contents` **breaks query folding** — any transformations applied after it run entirely in the M engine.
- In the Power BI Service, the base URL must be a **static string literal** for data source credentials to bind correctly. Use `RelativePath` and `Query` for dynamic parts.
- For paginated APIs, combine `Web.Contents` with `List.Generate` or a recursive function to fetch multiple pages.

### Typical usage patterns

**GET request with query parameters:**

```powerquery
let
    Source = Web.Contents("https://api.example.com/data", [
        Query = [category = "electronics", page = "1"],
        Headers = [Accept = "application/json"]
    ]),
    Parsed = Json.Document(Source)
in
    Parsed
```

**POST request with a JSON body:**

```powerquery
let
    Body = Json.FromValue([name = "Test", value = 42]),
    Source = Web.Contents("https://api.example.com/items", [
        Content = Body,
        Headers = [#"Content-Type" = "application/json"]
    ]),
    Parsed = Json.Document(Source)
in
    Parsed
```

**Handling specific HTTP status codes manually:**

```powerquery
let
    Response = Web.Contents("https://api.example.com/item/999", [
        ManualStatusHandling = {404}
    ]),
    Status = Value.Metadata(Response)[Response.Status],
    Result = if Status = 404 then "Not Found" else Json.Document(Response)
in
    Result
```

## Examples

Since `Web.Contents` requires network access, live output examples are not shown. See the Remarks section above for typical usage patterns.
